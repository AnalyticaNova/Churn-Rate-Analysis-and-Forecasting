    "**1. Gender and Churn**\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Finding: Churn rates are nearly the same for male (26.24%) and female (26.89%) customers, with a slight increase for those who prefer not to disclose gender (28.57%).\n",
    "Insight: Gender alone does not seem to be a strong predictor of churn. However, it may interact with other factors like age or group size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation: Focus on other demographic or behavioral factors rather than targeting gender-based retention strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Age and Churn**\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Finding: Older customers (50+) have the highest churn rate (30.96%), while younger customers (under 30) churn the least (22.70%).\n",
    "Insight: Older customers may find it harder to adapt to new services or experience dissatisfaction with evolving technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation: Introduce personalized support and loyalty incentives for older customers, while focusing on engagement strategies for younger ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Senior Status and Churn**\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Finding: Seniors have a significantly higher churn rate (37.97%) than non-seniors (24%).\n",
    "Insight: Seniors may require better customer service, simpler plans, or more accessible digital experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation: Provide senior-friendly services such as dedicated support lines and simplified billing plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Group Size and Churn**\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Finding: Customers in groups have a much lower churn rate (6%) compared to individuals (33%).\n",
    "Insight: Social or family plans create stickiness, likely due to shared contracts or bundled benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation: Encourage group or family plan adoption with discounts, additional perks, or referral bonuses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. State-Level Churn Variations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Finding: Churn varies significantly by state, with California (39.02%) and Ohio (34.81%) showing high churn rates.\n",
    "Insight: Certain states may have stronger competition, weaker network coverage, or less effective customer service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation: Investigate local factors such as network performance, competitor pricing, and targeted retention strategies in high-churn states.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Intersection of Age, State, and Churn**\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Finding: Certain age groups in specific states exhibit extremely high churn (e.g., 48.39% in PA for 30-50-year-olds).\n",
    "Insight: Churn is not just an age-based issue; location-based factors (e.g., local competitors, pricing, service quality) may play a role.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation: Conduct localized customer satisfaction surveys and analyze competitor offerings to address specific regional pain points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Gender, Group Size, and Senior Status in Churn**\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Finding: Senior males and females without group memberships have the highest churn (~41%), while those in groups churn significantly less.\n",
    "Insight: Seniors in isolation may feel less inclined to stay, possibly due to a lack of perceived value or difficulties in navigating services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation: Offer discounts for seniors joining group plans, along with exclusive benefits for individual senior customers to improve retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall Business Recommendations:**\n",
    "- Expand Group Plans: Promote bundled plans to lower churn rates.\n",
    "- Improve Senior Retention: Tailor support and simplify services for older customers.\n",
    "- Localize Retention Efforts: Address regional churn drivers with targeted offers.\n",
    "- Enhance Service for Older Customers: Provide dedicated support and user-friendly features.\n",
    "- Investigate State-Level Competitor Strategies: Adjust pricing and network quality to remain competitive in high-churn areas.\n",
    "- This analysis highlights the impact of demographics on churn and provides actionable insights for improving customer retention."

    "\n",
    "Key Finding: Customers with longer account durations use significantly more local and international minutes and pay higher total charges.\n",
    "Insight: Long-term customers have higher engagement and spending, likely due to established habits and reliance on the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation: Introduce loyalty rewards, exclusive discounts, or premium offers to retain high-value long-term customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. International Plan and Churn**\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Finding: Customers with an international plan have a slightly lower churn rate (24.3%) than those without (26.8%).\n",
    "Insight: The international plan adds value, possibly making customers less likely to switch providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation: Promote international plans to frequent travelers and international callers, potentially bundling them with loyalty programs.\n",

    "**3. International Usage and Extra Charges**\n",

    "Key Finding: Higher international usage correlates with higher extra international charges.\n",
    "Insight: Customers making many international calls may face unexpected charges, leading to dissatisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation: Offer transparent pricing, usage alerts, and customizable international bundles to improve customer satisfaction.\n",

    "**4. Data Plan and Download Behavior**\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Finding: Customers with unlimited data plans download nearly 3× more (8.55 GB vs. 2.90 GB).\n",
    "Insight: Customers with unlimited plans are heavy data users, indicating a strong demand for high-speed internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation: Optimize network performance for heavy users and introduce tiered unlimited plans based on usage patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. State-Level Total Charges**\n",
    "Key Finding: Delaware (DE), Florida (FL), and North Carolina (NC) have the highest average total charges per customer.\n",
    "Insight: These states may have higher pricing models, more high-value customers, or different service offerings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation: Investigate regional pricing strategies, customer satisfaction levels, and potential competition in these states.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Local Call Usage and Churn**\n",
    "Key Finding: Low-usage customers churn at a much higher rate (47.88%) than medium (21.57%) and high-usage (10.92%) customers.\n",
    "Insight: Customers with low engagement may lack attachment to the service or find better alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation: Target low-usage customers with personalized retention offers, such as usage-based discounts or engagement-driven incentives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Add-On Services Adoption**\n",
    "Key Finding: 82.58% of customers have at least one add-on service (Intl Active, Device Protection, Unlimited Data).\n",
    "Insight: Add-ons increase stickiness, likely reducing churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation: Encourage more customers to adopt add-ons by offering discounts, free trials, or bundling options.\n",

    "**8. Correlation Between Monthly Charges and Extra Charges**\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Finding: Weak correlation between monthly charges and extra data (0.12) or international charges (0.08).\n",
    "Insight: Customers with high monthly bills do not necessarily incur high extra charges, indicating different spending behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation: Personalize billing strategies—offer unlimited add-ons for high spenders and control options for budget-conscious users.\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. Common Plan Types Among High-Churn Customers**\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Finding: The highest number of churned customers were on unlimited data plans without device protection.\n",
    "Insight: Unlimited data alone is not enough to retain customers—other factors like device protection and bundled services matter.\n",

    "Our analysis reveals critical factors driving customer churn, highlighting issues in service usage, plan structures, customer support interactions, and churn motivations. Customers with shorter account tenures show lower service usage but still face significant charges, suggesting a potential mismatch between pricing and perceived value. Those with international plans churn slightly less, but high international usage leads to substantial extra charges, which could be a source of dissatisfaction. Moreover, customers on unlimited data plans consume far more but are not necessarily retained better, indicating that value perception, rather than sheer data limits, influences retention. High-churn states may require localized strategies, while low local call usage correlates with high churn, suggesting that less-engaged customers are at risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer support interactions strongly impact churn, with a drastic rise in churn for those making multiple service calls. Month-to-month contracts, paper check payments, and direct debit users exhibit the highest churn, especially when combined with multiple service calls, signaling frustration with billing and service experiences. Furthermore, churn reasons reveal that dissatisfaction, competitor offers, and pricing are dominant drivers. Attitude-related churn reaches 100%, indicating that negative service interactions are deal-breakers. Dissatisfaction with product offerings, network reliability, and customer service expertise also contribute significantly, showing gaps in perceived value and support.\n",
    "\n",
    "To combat churn, businesses should enhance customer engagement early, improving perceived value for new customers while introducing targeted retention offers for at-risk segments. Addressing high extra international charges, optimizing unlimited data pricing, and improving customer service—especially for high-contact users—are crucial. Offering proactive support and ensuring contract flexibility can reduce churn, while payment incentives can shift customers away from high-risk payment methods. Lastly, deeper analysis into state-wise churn patterns and competitor offerings can help refine localized strategies, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Business Actions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improve Customer Support Quality: Train staff, monitor sentiment, and offer proactive escalations.\n",
    "- Encourage Longer-Term Contracts: Offer discounts and rewards for One-Year and Two-Year plans.\n",
    "- Promote Digital Payments: Incentivize Credit Card usage to reduce churn risk.\n",
    "- Personalize Retention Strategies: Identify high-risk customers based on service calls, contract type, and payment method, and offer  targeted interventions.\n",
    "- Monitor Competitor Offerings & Price Sensitivity: Adjust pricing and service features to remain competitive."
